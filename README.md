## About

This program was made for a graduate thesis for Object Oriented Programming 2 as a subject. Two of the tasks completed in this repository were making a chess engine and a chess playing interface. 

The programs strength was measured against human players. While this engine is far weaker than most of the top chess engines used today, it reached 90 percentile versing human players on chess.com.

Making of this program was a great exercise of Java programming and Object Oriented Programming. 

User makes moves by drag and drop of pieces but the engine moves pieces instantly.
